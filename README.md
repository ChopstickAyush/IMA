## MILLER RABIN TEST
 The test is used to find primality test of no's within few seconds though its not deterministic its probabilistic but in each run the probability of 
 being wrong reduces to half so after 5 to 10 trials its almost sure to be correct. I have provided the code for the same.
## RSA ENCRYPTION TEST
RSA cryptosystem is based on modulus , Fermat's little principle and some other properties in number theory. It is used to share information between 
2 person's through a public channel using private and public member key. The key point being its not possible to break n into two prime factors p ,q 
if p and q are sufficiently large.
## BACKTRACK (ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM -HALL'S THEOREM AND BFS)
This problem arise frequently like given a list of jobs and employee such that each employe gets the job according to its capability and as well as noone is left to get a job. This can be solved using ideas of Hall's Theorem and BFS in graph theory. And vode for the same has been provided in backtrack.cpp.
